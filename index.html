      <p> Have you or your business been wronged? Does the cost and risk of suing put you off? Do you rightly question whether no win, no fee really means no win, no fee? 
      </p>
        
      <p>
        Perhaps you already started a claim but didn't realise it can be moved to us, fully insured and funded, both interest and risk free?

          <p>Crucially, we focus on litigating- and fully funding - claims and disputes typically below $1,000,000. We cover most types of commercial dispute, all forms of professional, clinical and medical negligence, serious personal injury as well as other complex damages based personal and business litigation.</p>
  
          <p>We believe that the combination of our exclusive day one- deferred and contingent - commercial insurance scheme combined with our fully funded 100% conditional fee agreements, offers our clients a distinct litigation and cost advantage.</p>
